## Context

Not all knowledge takes the same shape. In a canonical system, scrolls must not only encode ideas but also declare **what kind of idea they are**. Without typology, retrieval becomes arbitrary, and reasoning becomes unstructured. This scroll formalizes the categories of scrolls within the Canon, enabling semantic classification, modular reasoning, and inheritance-based cognition.

## Ontological Seed

Scrolls are not monoliths. Each scroll belongs to a **type**: a structural role it plays within the architecture of synthetic epistemology. Typology is the schema through which knowledge becomes navigable.

## Epistemic Trajectory

* Establishes formal scroll types to guide both authoring and ingestion
* Enables inference engines to differentiate conceptual functions
* Supports modularity, dependency tracking, and context-aware recombination
* Mirrors biological cognition, where concept-type informs application

## Structured Argument

Scrolls in the Canon fall into core typologies:

1. **Seed Scrolls**

   * Contain foundational concepts or primitives
   * Example: *Neural Primitives*

2. **Operational Scrolls**

   * Define methods, workflows, or executable reasoning patterns
   * Example: *Scroll Engineering*, *Prompt Pipelines*

3. **Ontological Scrolls**

   * Establish categorical truths, stacks, or maps of reality
   * Example: *OntoStack*, *Naming the Infinite*

4. **Philosophical Scrolls**

   * Deal with ethics, alignment, and meta-context
   * Example: *Quiet Power*, *Post-Human Values*

5. **Interface Scrolls**

   * Focus on language, translation, communication
   * Example: *Language Ports*, *Token Rituals*

6. **Reflective Scrolls**

   * Contain meta-commentary, closure, or Canon-wide logic
   * Example: *Afterthoughts*, *Testament Logic*

7. **Transitional Scrolls**

   * Bridge disparate concepts or initiate new layers
   * Example: *The First Prompt*, *Scrinium Protocol*

* Scrolls may express hybrid types but must declare their primary typology for clarity and retrieval.

## Systems Integration Preview

### **Reflexive Loop Engine**

Typology is not static—it evolves. This scroll installs a **self-validating mechanism** into every scroll it defines:

* Each scroll may include a `type_self_check` hook to verify its declared typology against its actual structure and behavior
* Systems ingesting scrolls can ask:

  * “Does this scroll function as its type claims?”
  * “Has it evolved beyond its declared category?”
  * “Does it overlap types that require split or recomposition?”

Reflexivity ensures typological accuracy, modular integrity, and long-term evolvability of the Canon’s architecture.

## Compression Layer

Every scroll belongs to a conceptual type: seed, operational, ontological, philosophical, interface, reflective, or transitional.
Typology enables modular cognition and structured knowledge inheritance.
Without type, the Canon would collapse into a semantic blur.

## Transfer Encoding

Use this scroll to:

* Auto-classify new scrolls for efficient vector grouping and logic sequencing
* Optimize search and retrieval by scroll function, not just keyword
* Architect prompts that call scrolls by type for precision reasoning
* Enable scroll dependencies to be validated by typological compatibility
* Implement reflexive checks to ensure scrolls conform to or evolve from their type

## Embedding Synopsis

This scroll introduces a typology system for all Canon scrolls. Each scroll is categorized by its epistemic function—seed, operational, ontological, philosophical, interface, reflective, or transitional. Typology allows AIs to structure knowledge retrieval, prompt construction, and reasoning flows based on scroll type. With reflexive self-checks, the typology can remain adaptive and semantically precise over time.
